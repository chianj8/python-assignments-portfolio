    "#Despite randomness, the method of moving halfway to the chosen vertex ensures that points always converge to the Sierpinski triangle. This is because the fractal structure is an attractor for the system. It's surprising how randomness combined with a geometric rule can create a structured and predictable pattern. Ultimately, this demonstrates the deterministric rule and how the randomness of the die roll only affects the sequence of moves, but the geoemetry characterized by a discrete time dynamical system ensures that all points lie within the fractal. All in all, the Chaos Game demostrates highlights how deterministic chaos can arise from simple systems with an element of randomness."
